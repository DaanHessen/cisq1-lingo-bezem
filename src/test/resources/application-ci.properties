# Intended for continuous integration (ci)
#
# This properties file is only used when "ci" is set as an active profile.
#
# It is necessary because certain infrastructure, such as postgresql,
# is not available in our continuous integration pipeline.
#
# Using mvn or mvnw, you can set the profile as follows (for instance, when running tests):
#
#       mvnw test -Dspring.profiles.active=ci
#
# An alternative to using H2 would be using a PostgreSQL container in the CI pipeline
# by either declaring it within the job or by using something like test containers
